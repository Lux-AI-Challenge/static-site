## Internationalization

In [public/locales/] are two files, `en.json, zh.json` containing the localizations for English and Chinese.

Whenever adding site content, anything that should be translated should be added into there.

It is organized by Page Name e.g. `Home` or component name e.g. `Header` first.

If a part of a localization, the content will default to English.
