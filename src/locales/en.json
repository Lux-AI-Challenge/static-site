      "body1": "Lux is an AI programming game competition.",
      "body2": "Teams are given the Lux design specification. Starting off with a very basic strategy, teams will improve and upload new submissions to the competition and compete directly against other competitors to climb the leaderboard.",
      "body3": "Generally, the competition involves a multi-variable optimization and resource gathering and allocation problem in a 1v1 scenario against competitor bots. Successful submissions will not only involve solving this optimization, but also responding to the opposite team and coming out on top.",
      "body4": "You and your team will have to make improvements to unit navigation, resource gathering, macro and micro strategies and more to incrementally increase the power of your bot. See the other competitions for examples: ",
      "body5": "We are focused on user-centered, inclusive, and engaging designs that work to bring wide ranging complexity but maintain accessibility for our competitors. We're dedicated to crafting competitions that require creativity and out-of-the-box thinking."
