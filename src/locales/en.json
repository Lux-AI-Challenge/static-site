      "body1": "Lux is an AI programming game competition.",
      "body2": "Teams are given the Lux design specification. Starting off with a very basic player, teams will improve and upload new submissions to the scrimmage server where they will face off against other teams and receive sweet, sweet rating internet points. Details of the exact game design will be released on the first day of the competition June 14, 2021.",
      "body3": "Generally, the competition involves a multi-variable optimization and resource gathering and allocation problem in a 1v1 scenario against competitor bots. Successful submissions will not only involve solving this optimization, but also responding to the opposite team and coming out on top. (Think simplified starcraft)",
      "body4": "Each team starts with a very basic bot programmed to make random moves. You and your team will have to make improvements to unit navigation, resource gathering, macro and micro strategies and more to incrementally increase the power of your bot. See the other competitions for examples: ",
      "body5": "We are heavily focused on user-centered designs that work to bring wide ranging complexity but maintain accessibility for our competitors"
